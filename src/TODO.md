# TODO

- improve default/demo appearance
  - include hover states for interactive things
- arrow heads for edges
- allow implementing dragging multiple selected nodes at once
- better hotkeys (ctrl/shift split is annoying)
- maybe wrap core graph component with some sane defaults like for selection and deletion and node/edge creation?
- edge hover: how to only mark hovering when near the actual line?
- how to change the appearance of nodes that are being hovered for edge creation?
- snap-to-grid
- box select
- implement pan/zoom controlled props and constraints
  - maybe "constraints" are really "settings"?
- pan/zoom controls
- flesh out demo pages
  - show pan/zoom values and allow settings/disabling them
  - basic autolayout implementation
  - what else?
- CSS classes all over the place to allow for customization
- perf?
- DOM rendering?
- canvas rendering?
- audit event handling to make sure it works as intended (for instance, node drag/background click overlap in using document-mouse-up)
- alternate data model: only takes array of node IDs and an adjacency list?
