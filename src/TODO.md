# TODO

- pan/zoom mouse interactions
  - include pinching gesture if possible
- pan/zoom controls
- background click handler
- selection:
  - does this need to be built-in, or can simple click handlers on custom render functions do it?
  - what about for edges?
- deletion:
  - does this need to be built-in, or can the consumer do selection/keypress handling themselves?
- context menus?
- edge hover: how to only mark hovering when near the actual line?
- grid customization
- how to change the appearance of nodes that are being hovered for edge creation?
- snap-to-grid
- one-time autolayouts (or should these be "plugins"?)
  - best-effort DAG
  - spring layout
- box select
- perf?
- maybe wrap core graph component with some sane defaults like for selection and deletion?
- DOM rendering?
- canvas rendering?
