# TODO

- maybe wrap core graph component with some sane defaults like for selection and deletion and node/edge creation?
- context menus?
- edge hover: how to only mark hovering when near the actual line?
- how to change the appearance of nodes that are being hovered for edge creation?
- snap-to-grid
- when first rendering, attempt to bring 0, 0 to the center of the viewport
- box select
- implement pan/zoom controlled props and constraints
  - maybe constraints are really settings?
- pan/zoom controls
- flesh out demo pages
  - add control strip
  - show pan/zoom values and allow settings/disabling them
  - allow customizing grid
  - basic autolayout implementation
  - what else?
- CSS classes all over the place to allow for customization
- perf?
- DOM rendering?
- canvas rendering?
